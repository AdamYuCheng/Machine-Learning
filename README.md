# Machine-Learning
Here are some notes of my personal record and practice in machine learning field.

## My Personal Try And Research
1. Exploratory Data Analysis On Iris Dataset  
    Summarize exploratory data analysis methods  in iris dataset
    
2. Linear Model For Regression  
    Training and comparing different linear regression models' performance and some strategies of finding the best regression model 
    
3. Taiwan ETF Prediction
    Use gradient boosting regressor model to predict the ETF price  

4. Kaggle House Prediction   
    The code for kaggle 'House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques
    
5. Compare Classification Model Performance  
    Compare the training time and f1 score between 5 basic classifcation model  
    
6. Image Classification  
    Use fast ai library to classify the where am I dataset

## In My Toolbox
Collect some template for machine learning and deep learning.  

### For Machine Learning 
1. Logistic Regression - use logistic regression to classify data 
2. Decision Tree - use decision tree to classigy data
3. K means - use k means method to cluster the data
4. K Nearest Neighbors - classification data
5. Support Vector Machine - classification data
6. One class SVM(Anomaly detection) - sample of anomaly detection
7. Linear regression model - regression model with tunning
